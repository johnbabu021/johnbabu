                Everyone has a story. My story begins with double
                sided journey, journey within and journey without.
                Journey throughout the life, full of knowledge and
                growth, where sophisticated fabrics of mind are
                crafted into wisdom. Journey around the world,
                full of experience and flavour, where profound
                colors of soul are painted into worth.

                A story that has oblivious beginning and sound
                remaining. A story with three ages in between.

            </p>
