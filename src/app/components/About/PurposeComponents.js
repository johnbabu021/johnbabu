            <p>
                My purpose is to interconnect human population
                into virtuous global consciousness and to express my
                natural true and optimal best as profound as possible.

                I do so because I believe in singular purpose and care
                for connection, because I value our world principles and human virtues, our life meaning and genuine reasoning, our innate potential and freedom of soul.

                My mission is to connect, rebalance, and mentor our
                global community through worldwide successors and professionals, through innovative technology and
                intelligent design, through epic stories and language.

                I do so by bringing great minds and creative souls
                together to resolve our global scale problems so that,
                all together, we can collectively evolve and harmoniously enjoy our new world.
